def append_write(filename="", text=""):
    """Appends a string at the end of a text file (UTF-8) and returns the number of characters added.

    This function opens the specified file in append mode, which ensures that the string `text`
    is added to the end of the file without modifying its existing content. If the file doesn't exist,

    Args:
        filename (str): The name of the file to append to.
        text (str): The text to append to the file.

    Returns:
        int: The number of characters added to the file.
    
    Example:
        nb_characters_added = append_write("file.txt", "Hello again!")
        print(nb_characters_added)
