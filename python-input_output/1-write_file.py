Module for writing a string to a text file and returning the number of characters written.

This module contains a function `write_file` that writes a string to a specified file
in UTF-8 encoding. If the file doesn't exist, it is created. If the file already exists,
its content is overwritten.

Functions:
    write_file(filename="", text=""): Writes the string `text` to the file `filename`
                                       and returns the number of characters written.
