"""
Module for defining a Square class that inherits from Rectangle.

This module contains the `Square` class, which inherits from the `Rectangle` class.
It represents a square and includes methods to validate the size, calculate the area,
and provide a string representation of the square.

The `Square` class uses the `integer_validator` method inherited from `Rectangle` 
to validate the size of the square before assigning it to the private attribute.

Functions:
    Square: A class that represents a square, with methods to validate its size,
            compute its area, and provide a string representation.

    A class that represents a square, inheriting from the Rectangle class.

    This class inherits from the Rectangle class and validates that the size

    area of a square) and return a string representation of the square.

    Attributes:
        __size (int): The size of the square, validated as a positive integer.

    Methods:
        __init__(self, size): Initializes a new Square object with size.
