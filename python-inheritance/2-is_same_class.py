""" 
Module for checking if an object is exactly an instance of a specified class.

This module contains a function `is_same_class` that checks if a given object
is exactly an instance of a specified class, and not an instance of a subclass.
It helps in confirming the type of an object in situations where exact type matching
is required.

Functions:
    is_same_class(obj, a_class): Returns True if obj is exactly an instance of a_class.

    Args:
        obj (any): object of any type.
        a_class (class): the class to compare the object with.

    Returns:
        bool: True if obj is exactly an instance of a_class, False otherwise.
