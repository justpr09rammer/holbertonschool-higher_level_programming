Module for BaseGeometry class.

This module contains the `BaseGeometry` class with a public instance method `area`
which raises an exception if called directly, to be implemented by subclasses.

Functions:

    A base class for geometry-related classes.

    This class serves as a base for other geometry-related classes. It contains
    an unimplemented method `area()`, which is expected to be overridden by
    subclasses to compute the area of specific geometric shapes.

    Methods:
        area(self): Raises an Exception indicating that this method must be
                    implemented by subclasses.
