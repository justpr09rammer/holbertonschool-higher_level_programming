"""
Module for defining a Rectangle class that inherits from BaseGeometry.

This module contains the `Rectangle` class, which inherits from `BaseGeometry`.
It includes methods to validate the rectangle's dimensions, calculate its area,
and provide a string representation of the rectangle in the format [Rectangle] <width>/<height>.

The `Rectangle` class validates that the `width` and `height` are positive integers
using the inherited `integer_validator` method from `BaseGeometry`.

Functions:
    Rectangle: A class representing a rectangle, with methods to validate dimensions, 
               calculate the area, and provide a string representation.

    This class represents a rectangle, with methods to validate its dimensions

    Attributes:

    Methods:
